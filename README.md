# hello-world

Hi 

Koondan here, I am learning how to use githud and creating repository and branches.
At work other colleagues use this for projects, and instead of waiting for someone to 
teach me, I want to learn it by myself and as such seek advice and explanation from 
my colleauges at work.  Therefore, i will be able to understand what they are saying 
and most important, i will not take long to start working on projects.
